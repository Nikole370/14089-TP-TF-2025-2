I decided to do this, because I believe that the brand could have either reinforced the bag that’s meant to hold the stone or they could have recommended that the buyer could themselves. Mine was in its little bag as it slipped off the counter. I keep telling myself that maybe it would have helped cushion the fall if the bag had padding. I really hope that others can learn from my stupid mistake and make sure to be especially cautious if you decide to purchase this item. Before the heart wrenching loss, I was really seeing results and put in the effort and extra time to use it during my morning and night time routine. The “short term“ results right after using the stone really made my roundish face seem more contoured and defined (talking about my cheekbones) but it didn’t last long. I think with continued use the “long term“ results will have more of a lasting effect over time. I dread the thought of replacing my old one that’s in pieces, but I do believe that it’s something that’s worth repurchasing.

I used the Clarisonic many years ago so I am familiar with cleansing brushes.  I was eager to test and try this cleansing brush as it is not battery operated and had intriguing silicone bristles in the center.Pros:-The bristles and silicone center are super soft and flexible.  -This seemed to very gently exfoliate my face during the cleansing process while not causing any irritation.  It didn’t cause any breakouts or redness to my very sensitive face.-I liked how it wasn’t on a timer like the battery operated versions so I could use it as long or short as I liked.  -I liked that I could control the speed of movement and pressure with my own hand.-It is compact and easy for travel.  Its compact brush size also enables you to target specific small areas better than a cleansing brush with a bigger brush head.Cons:-While I liked that it is compact in size, the brush head is really small.  Therefore, cleansing your face takes more time and more effort than with a brush head with a larger surface area.-I didn’t find it to remove my makeup as well as I would have hoped.  I found it to work better after using makeup remover and then following up with the cleansing brush.-No directions for how to clean the brush or how often.Tips: I wold recommend applying the cleanser to your face first and lathering slightly with your hands. Then, use the cleansing brush with the cleanser already evenly distributed on your face. This kept me from having to use more cleanser than I would normally use and seemed to remove the remaining makeup best for me.Final thoughts: I’m not sure I would repurchase in the future only because I found it rather small and didn’t seem to do too much for me. I would recommend this to others who enjoy using cleansing brushes though. It is a good product. It’s just not a necessity for me.",Nice Cleansing Brush,light,hazel,combination,blonde,P472057,Vegan Makeup Remover and Cleansing Brush,SEPHORA COLLECTION,14.0

When I went to Sephora for the sale I asked about a night creme and explained the situation.

The blade is sturdy and high quality. Shaving my legs is easy because it’s fine hair, but I kinda got scared on my armpits and bikini line. It takes a little practice to maneuver the razor when it comes to angles because of the weight. I still exfoliate my skin before putting on the pillow shave for the best results to get smooth skin. The pillow shave gives a thin film that I had to layer a lot to feel suffice for a shave. The other pieces in the kit like the razor holder and bin are cute but if you had to budget, the razor and blades are good enough.

When I saw this was a sample - I grabbed it! I am SO, so glad I did!First the Cloth ~ I measured this cloth to be 7.5 by 6.5 inches. That’s a pretty good size since some of the other products I’ve bought were much smaller. This cloth is certified orangic and 100% pure cotton. It has to be the SOFTEST cloth I’ve ever felt or used. And it is thick, thicker then any other cloth I’ve used. And after all your face has some of the softest skin on your body so you want something that is soft tuching it. The cloth didn’t rip, tear, or even look like it was going to come apart.I love that it has 6 Essential Oils - they protect your face and nurture at the same time. The Birch Sap is a wonderful moisturizer and retains moisture in your skin. The water itself is mineral rich from a hot spring in Japan. There’s no petroleum mineral oil, no fragrances or artifical coloring. The perfect combination to clean and moisturize your skin!I read a review that says there’s nothing but Parabens in this product. The ingredients are, and I’m reading them off of the packet itself.... Water, 6 Essential Oils of Rosemary, Sage, Lavender, Olive, Ginger, and Papaya Leaf Extracts, Birch Sap - a moisture retaine, Peg-7 which are fatty acids that come from Coconut Oil- a conditioner, Dipropylene Glycol - a combination of 3 isomeric compounds which combine to make a solvent - which is what dissolves your makeup! Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine which is a leading “replacement“ for Silicone, Lactic Acid which adjusts acidity and as a disinfectant, AND Methylparaben which is “in“ the Paraben family and is used in cosmetics as a preservative. Glycerin which is a Humectant, which means it helps seal in moisture and also helps to enhance the cleaning aspect of a product. And Amino Acids which are the “building blocks“ of protein. And they make up 75% of our bodies and is essential to just about every fiunction of our body.I feel people should investigate ingredients before they make a purchase if they are worried about what’s in it! I would never put anything on my face that could harm it. I used to make bath and body products so I know how important the ingredients play in the purchase of a product. There HAS to be an ingredient <a paraben> that will preserve the product or it will go bad within a month, maybe sooner, maybe longer. Nobody wants to spend money on a product that they HAVE to use in 30 days or you have to toss it. But just because it has a paraben ingredient in it does not make it bad.That said, everyone is entitled to use whatever they want, it is their skin afterall.After all I’ve said ~ I gve this product 10 stars. It took my makeup, even waterproof, completely off my face without any irritation to my skin or eyes. These Spa Cloths made my skin feel better then anyting I’ve ever used. In my opinion - it’s the BEST Cleanser out there.",AWESOME Cleanser & Mosturizer!,lightMedium,green,combination,,P294018,Cleansing Spa Water Cloths,Koh Gen Do,23.0

I know the importance of moisturizing but it’s so frustrating applying moisturizer and looking greasy within 30 minutes. Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Oil-Free Gel Cream honestly surprised me because it works very well with my skin. The consistency is very smooth and lightweight. After I applied it to my skin, it dried down to a matte finish which I LOVE. This is the only moisturizer that actually held up throughout the day, I was noticeably less oily than I normally am. The product came at a great time because my skin had some dry patches from a new face wash and this definitely revived my skin. While I could rave about this even longer, I do want to note a flaw. As someone else has mentioned, the 1.7oz size is SMALL. For $32, you’re definitely going to through this quick. I love the formula but I don’t know if I’d want to go and have to repurchase it multiple times. With that said, a little goes a long way so I’m hoping to get as much use out of it as I can. Overall, I really enjoy this moisturizer and if you’re someone who has been looking for something that won’t make you greasy, I recommend trying this out!","Finally, a moisturizer that works for oily skin!",mediumTan,brown,oily,black,P470040,Ultra Facial Oil-Free Gel Cream,Kiehl's Since 1851,38.0

When I am using, I get a little self conscious of hugging my loved ones because I feel the smell is so obvious that they will know that my natural-looking tan is very unnatural (noting here that yes I think it looks quite natural!). I hate painting my nails, and this absolutely stains my nails no matter how much a scrub my hands after application. Short nails or painted nails it is when this product is in rotation. Bonus: it has never rubbed off on clothes/sheets! Tl;dr: expect a self-tanner scent, use with a lotion such as Cerave, does not transfer to clothing, expect one shade darker and nothing dramatic (I’ve never had a friend say “omg you look so tan!“ which to me is the ultimate test in the dead of winter in New England).",Good but only if you accept the downfalls,light,,combination,brown,P424989,THE BODY Illuminating Self-Tan Drops,TAN-LUXE,60.0

I’d been using another cleansing oil, but my skin felt very tight and dry after, but it seemed to be doing the job so I kept using it because it was really inexpensive and I liked the smell and idea of it.

It’s not over powering and just smells nice and sweet and fresh. The texture is a little bit gritty, but not too bad. I was skeptical about putting it on dry skin because I’m so used to wetting my face first, but once I started rubbing my hands together, it did indeed turn more into a lotion consistency and then rubbed it on my face and it really did seem to melt through my make-up and onto my skin.It does a great job at removing everything and my skin doesn’t feel as tight afterwards. I wanted to give this time to actually see how my skin would react as it’s very sensitive and prone to breakouts and it may be a combination of things, but so far my skin has reacted quite well to this, so I’m going to keep using it.My only negative really is the price for amount of product.

I absolutely  love this wrinkle cream, I use it every day on my face underneath my make-up. The cream is very light with a fresh clean light scent. It does not take more than about a dime size to go completely over the entire area of your face. It is very light, it goes on silky leaving my skin feeling fresh and vibrant.

Not only does this sunscreen vanish into your skin leaving it smooth, supple and nourished but it imparts a heavenly glow. My face looks healthy, radiant and natural without looking like I have anything on. It has unmatched UVA/UVB defense, utilizing only mineral actives (a necessity) to do so. Murad has also thrown in anti-oxidants, increasing its efficacy and ensuring long-lasting complete protection. The only con, which to me doesn’t devalue the product whatsoever, is that it’s so good at quickly melding with your skin, it can be hard to tell how much was put on. If you’re a skin-freak like I am, you want it over every crack and crevice which made me worry about how long it would last; since this is a pricey item, it caused mild anxiety for me the first couple of days before I perfected exactly how much my face needs.Given its price, I only use this on my face.
