To be completely honest I did not notice a significant difference, the main improvement that I saw was it did even out the lines around the sides of my eyes a fraction.

I tried it both after using my favorite toner (Lancome Tonique) as well as on its own after cleansing (I wanted to see if the effects were distinguishable). It wasn’t a mind-altering difference, but I imagine that with any serum, it’s at least marginally more effective after toner application.The main thing that I noticed is that my skin felt incredibly smooth the morning after - solidly supporting the claims of “smoother after 4 hours“. The next claim is firmer-looking after 10 days, which was a bit more difficult for me to judge since I wouldn’t say that my skin has lost a significant amount of elasticity [yet]. (For full disclosure, I get monthly facials at a medispa.)Interestingly, a couple of reviewers have mentioned a very strong fragrance. I have a very sensitive nose, but find the fragrance to be fairly mild and pleasant in a nostalgic way. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it smells like beauty products that I smelled when I was a child/teenager - like a mix between baby lotion, floral notes, and sunblock.

I spent a year testing a variety of products and found that Herbivore worked best for my skin.

I know there seemed to be some complaints about how crazy thick it is, but I see it as a little going a long way, and I think one jar will last me at least four months or so. Plus The price point is amazing. I was so tired of spending so much money on night creams that just left my face feeling greasy and broke me out. My skin felt really nourished and moisturized when I woke up in the morning – and no break outs so far. As for reducing the lines and wrinkles, I can’t really speak to that at this moment.

I have been using it for about 2 weeks and I can tell a difference from day to day when I use it and I don’t. The product is so smooth it glides on like nothing I have used before. The application tip is such a amazing touch to this product. It stays cold so when you apply the product the cold helps to de-puff your under eyes.

The first day after I used it, I woke up with really plump, hydrated looking skin, and it’s been a solid performer ever since. My pores look smaller  and the lines by my eyes are less noticeable.

I have mild acne and also get hormonal breakouts. I had a big, pink acne scar on my cheek that didn’t improve for 6 months, but after I started using this oil, it began to heal more quickly. (Also, I would advise anyone who is acne prone to spot test this first. You never know what might make you break out.)I don’t have a problem with the scent.

I had to stop using the essence as at that time, it was clogging my pores and only worsened the breaking out. I was disheartened that I had to waste away whole bottle of essence, but decided to just keep it. After I was able to get my breakouts under control, I was left wit a lot of dark pigmented spots and my skin just looked frail and oily but dry at the same time. I decided to try the essence one day when I ran out of my moisturizer and boy am I grateful that I did that. its been 3 months using this product now and my skin is luminous, luscious, radiant, even and my spots are faded almost completely gone, which I’m quite positive I will achieve in a months time. Everywhere I go now people ask me about my skin care, and how dewy and moisturized my skin has become. I would advise though that if you have oily skin, you use it with a gel based moisturizer as a cream can tend to make it more heavy and could potentially clog your pores from my experience. I use this morning and evening as part of my ski care routine and to think that I almost gave it away in my hopeless situation, I would have missed out on the real benefits of using this essence. I completely recommend it based form my experiences. even when I wear make up now, it blends evenly, unlike before I couldn’t even wear make up anymore.

Another thing I was confused is it’s a mask so typically it’s just apply and let set but with these tiny vitamin c capsules I felt I’d get more use of those if I help dissolve them into my skin better if I massage this jelly like mask.

Tan very easily thanks to my olive skin.I got a sample of this and liked it so much I decided to buy the full size. I’ve used all different brands of cleansers from low end to very high end ($75 and up) but I like this particular one for several reasons.One, it’s hard to squeeze out. I’m sure your wondering why I appreciate the fact that it’s hard to get out and that’s because I always squeeze out more than the pea sized amount that I need and thereby waste a bunch of product. This dosent break your hand when you try to squeeze it out, rather it just comes out more slowly.Two, it’s very thick. I don’t need to use alot because it’s very concentrated meaning I get more bang for my buck. Some of the cleansers I have used have seemed watered down but not this baby. It spreads all over your face.Three, I like the fact that it clears off all my thick makeup. I like to pack on the pancake and usually have to use a bunch of toner and cotton pads to wipe off residual makeup left behind by my cleansers but this clears it all off. It does have a nice soft scent and I haven’t broken out since using this product.The only negative thing I have to say about this cleanser is that it can be slightly too good at cleaning, not only stripping away makeup but the oils in my skin as well. My face sometimes literally squeaks when I rub it much like when you wash dishes and the detergent makes the dishes squeaky clean.

I was actually shocked. The skin that grows back to fill your scar may be less pigmented than the surrounding skin, but considering how much easier it is to camouflage simple discoloration than it is to conceal skin texture, I wasn’t really bothered.Cons: This made me break out so badly that after fixing the one scar, I didn’t continue using it. The ingredients seem innocuous but something in it definitely caused my perioral dermatitis to flare. Because of the container’s design (there’s a rollerball applicator that needs to be used to work the product into your skin) the tube itself can also collect bacteria; this left the area I treated with clogged pores every time. I couldn’t see any way of removing the ball but I guess that might be a solution. The product needs to be pressed firmly into the skin in order to work properly so I don’t know how well it would work if the cream was moved to a different container.So, you can absolutely fix a scar with this, but you’re facing a double-edged sword. If you’re good at healing your own acne while using other products at the same time, I suppose it could be worth a try. But if you’re prone to multiple whiteheads, cysts that stick around, blackheads that never come out, or bad dermatitis, continuing to use the product while being broken out will only make the situation worse and you’ll end up with even more scars to deal with.",Conflicted!,fair,blue,dry,red,P377368,D-Scar Scar Diminishing Serum,Kate Somerville,56.0
