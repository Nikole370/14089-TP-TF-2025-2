I have tried all sorts of home whitening systems, toothpastes, toothpaste add-ons, strips, gels, etc. This is so easy to use once you read the directions, and is much more comfortable sitting in your mouth than anything else. You can feel a bit of warmth from it but it’s not scary or uncomfortable, it’s subtle. I may not want to be seen in public with this thing in my mouth and this ipod thingy around my neck, but it’s a thousand times better than having those gross tasting strips slipping around your mouth while you’re waiting ten, twenty, thirty minutes. The gel has a minty taste and so far I can attest the fact that no sensitivity comes along with it. That’s been my major problem with most teeth whitening systems, as I have had to stop using them all once my teeth were in so much sharp pain. It’s definitely expensive, but I think that it costs way less than what I’ve spent over the years trying to whiten my teeth, and the system seems to really be worth it, especially if you have the sensitivity problem. So, if you can afford it, I say definitely go for it.",Love it!,,,,,P281835,GLO Brilliant White Smile - At Home Teeth Whitening Device,GLO Science,159.0

Usually for me to love products I take a few things into account: does the product work as intended? Does it leave my skin soft and smooth? Does it absorb well? And does it break me out? And the Magic Elixir was good on all of those fronts except the absorption part. It wasn’t bad by any means but it felt a little heavy on my skin compared to other serums that I use. I did have an amazingly dewy and soft finish the following day after using this product and will continue using it to see if I have continued lightening and brightening of my skin but am unsure if I will buy it out of my own pocket yet. The major thing that sets me off is the scent. Something about it makes it feel very HEAVY. Just the combination of the serum with the scent makes it feel rich, heavy, luxurious even—but for me I just want a serum that absorbs like a dream and barely feels like anything because I layer stuff ontop of it. I will say that my skin felt pretty amazing the next day when I used this in conjunction with the Magic Cream. Both together left my skin feeling moisturized, dewy, glowy and youthful. I am also a big fan of the packaging. It just feels rich. And I appreciate that when I spend a lot on a product.

I have some huge pores on and around my nose and have tried countless products to clear them and help these bad boys tighten up so honestly there was nothing to lose. I already understand that pore size can be larger from genetics, large oil glands or damaged pores and short of pore laser treatment my realistically bleak outlook understands that they will never permanently go away :(... But this was the first product I have ever used where it helped SHRINK them!I seriously thought I was just sampling some face mask that claims to help your skin in come way but it seriously brightened my skin and tightened the pores on my nose in one go! I was looking at the Glamglow mask but this seems to make a fierce competitor. But regardless, I have been trying skin care products to primers like Too Face and Smashbox pore minimizing primers and they did absolutely nothing since my makeup still settled into my pores. While this product claims to do more for the face, this was my personal experience with what it did for my medium, oily-to combination skin. I have an extremely Oily nose area and I left this mask on for the maximum of 10 minutes to reap all benefits so I waited until it dried completely. Its a thick to creamy consistency, and it dries relatively fast as you spread it so do it quickly. Its a pretty light pink color and has a nice botanic and almost like lavender scent to it which didn’t bother me. As this clay mask dried I was weirded out to see all these tiny dots around my nose which I realized were my pores, haha. But with that said and with my shrinking results I feel it absolutely did help clear my pores of impurities. I do not have sensitive skin and it’s pretty resilient to products, so I couldn’t help you there although from other reviews I have read it accommodates sensitive skin- just remember not everything works for everyone.I gave this product only 4 stars and not 5 because I am unsure if it is temporary results or long term with usage so hopefully its here to stay and I might just drop the pretty penny on a full size :) Hope this helped.",Actually Surprised,,,,,P395615,Pore Minimizing Instant Detox Mask,Caudalie,42.0

If you don’t blend fast enough it will cause horrible splatters on you. It’s also clear.. therefore it’s very easy to either over or undertan certain parts. I also want to say that it does have an orange hugh for me and fades to yellow instead of a nice glow. The smell is okay.. not something signature self tanner. It does transfer, I have an all white bed and there’s a cute little self tanner snow angel. Overall, I would still recommend this for pale blondes if you’re okay with the fading process.

When I was a teenager I used Proactiv (as I can only assume every teenager does, at one point or another), and in my mid-twenties I used Acne.org’s BP lotion for a long time, among other offerings, but no other benzoyl peroxide product I’ve used has ever been this nice. It is so finely milled, and the product base it is supplied in is so gentle. I went from using a 2.5% BP solution (so my skin can’t claim to have been unused to BP at all; also, I’ve got some experience with mild AHAs and BHAs), to this 5% solution, and experienced no irritation at the increase. It smoothes on evenly and leaves no tackiness, dryness, pulling of the skin, nothing (obviously, I always follow it with a moisturizer; this product is a treatment, and is not meant to replace your moisturizer). Weirdly, I’ve actually come to enjoy the physical sensation of putting it on, which is usually a perverse little pleasure of mine that comes from putting on my facial oils or moisturizers; it’s just pleasant. Usually I put it on in the morning and evening, but on low-key home based days, I’ve had no issues with putting it on mid-day as well, and following it with an oil (love those nourishing, chill days!) If you want an all-over benzoyl peroxide treatment (because BP is really rather useless as a spot treatment, let’s be real), this is definitely the one to go for.",Soild benzoyl peroxided treatment,,,combination,,P232907,Anti Bac Acne Clearing Lotion,Kate Somerville,56.0

I apply this toner after using the SK-II face wash and then I apply a ceramide serum or the Ordinary ninacinamide follwed by a moisturizer. I can say that I heavily invested in just my face wash and toner and the results were there. If this price tag is a little high for you I would try the Paula’s Choice salicylic acid toner.
