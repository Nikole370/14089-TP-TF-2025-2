After trying this out for almost 2 weeks, I would say for me personally that this moisturizer works well as a night cream, however during the day (even on my dry skin) it looks a bit too shiny/greasy for my own personal liking. I prefer a semi-matte look though, so if you’re someone who prefers a more dewy looks + has dry skin, this may be perfect for you. I can’t imagine how it would look on more oily skin types though (I’m guessing greasy, however I can’t fully comment on that).

This gel moisturizer is fragrance free no parabens is an oil-free refreshing gel cream that last 72 hours long! I enjoyed this but I will admit I did not see a big difference the only difference I did notice that my pores were smaller. And to me that’s a great thing so I will recommend this to everyone especially if you have large pores. This it’s really good for minimizing this problem. Saying this my sample was only .17 fluid ounces which in my opinion is not enough to really use it long enough to tell the difference. But I am sure that if I had used it for a long time I could have seen more of a difference. I will say that the lotion is very Cooling and has a calming effect to my skin.

There is a bit of tingling and after a few minutes, it goes away.  The key is not to slather it on but, as the instructions say, apply about 3-4 pumps of the product.

So I bought this product because Sephora was out of Boscia’s Makeup Breakup Oil. Everytime I use this, I feel like I cannot grab enough of this balm to break down all of my make up. It never really forms into an oil, but more like a filmy, plastic-like oil. I’ve tried warming it up in my hands with small portions, big portions and its always the same consistency.

Next time I used it over my makeup mid day and it soothed and refreshed my skin and my mind! Then I started experimenting with this as a toner, essence, and just wow. I mean wow. You can use this so many ways. I don’t even understand how such a clean and simple product can do so much good in so many ways but I know and see that it does.

I’m really happy with the results I’m getting. The only thing I would like to change is that it should have a sunblock factor added to it, and also for me it took a bit more than 7 day to reduce 70% of my redness and dark spots. But I will for sure recommend and keep buying it now, because I’m SUPER happy with the effect on the dark spots on my skin.",This is amazing for reduce dark spots and redness.,light,hazel,normal,brown,P415619,Dreamskin Skin Perfector,Dior,130.0
