I mix some of the Isle Of Paradise Dark tanning spray liquid with a pump or two of my favourite lotion and put that on my hands and feet for a more natural look. On my face I just spray the dark tanning spray all over. This gives me the perfect tan. It does not stain clothes or bed sheets as much as most tanners either which is great.

I’ve been using it for over a year, and have yet to develop a pimple (I have sensitive skin, and I sweat a lot on my face when I’m having hot flashes!).  Enter Unseen Sunscreen.  Super lightweight, and feels like silk going on, and it’s super blendable.  You can do it without looking in the mirror, how many sunscreens can you say that about?  Foundation (I use liquid) glides right on over it, as if I just applied a primer.  I have many ways of wearing this sunscreen.  Sometimes, I use the Supergoop city sunscreen serum underneath, especially when I feel I need that extra layer of moisture.  That dries on quickly.  Then, I add a half and half  plop of Unseen Sunscreen and my liquid foundation (Sephora 10-hour), and mix them up on my fingers and apply to my face.  The whole process takes less than a minute, and my skin feels light, and non-greasy, with just the right amount of coverage.  If I’m heading out for outdoor activities I apply this without the foundation to get the maximum SPF from it.  My skin feels so dewy, yet not greasy!

Let me start by saying I really love facial oils and was excited to get the opportunity to try this one out. For reference, I have very sensitive dry skin. Scent: This oil has a strong floral fragrance. It wasn’t too overbearing but it was a little strong for my liking. It reminded me of a cheap floral perfume. I wasn’t thrilled with the scent but it didn’t linger. Texture/consistency: This was a very light (like the name) watery oil. It was not greasy and did not make my skin feel greasy/ oily. However, it made my skin feel sticky. The sticky feeling did go away but it was definitely sticky for a good 30 min. What did it do for me: I used this in the morning and evening and it didn’t seem to do anything for me. My skin didn’t feel moisturized from this at all.

Within one week of using it dark marks that had been on my cheek from past breakouts for going on a year now were noticeably diminished!

I use this like a normal cleanser in the AM (just rub in and rinse) and then in the PM I rub it in and let it sit for about 5 minutes while I get ready to shower and then rinse it off.

These sets usually come with mini sizes of various DE products and they tend to include this one with many of their day sets. I cannot speak for the large size but the mini-tube has incredible packaging. It twists where only a tiny hole opens up on the cap and then you can squeeze the product out of the tube through it, which gives the user very great control of exactly how much product is being squeezed out. For a sun care product, this can be crucial as over-doing it can leave behind a slimy pilling on the skin. The Bad: This is one of Drunk Elephant worst products (if not, the worst). The sunscreen leaves behind a horrible white cast (and I have very fair skin... so on darker complexions I imagine this will be magnified). Furthermore, it feels... oily. I have so many of these minis that I always grab a few for sunny vacations just to have on hand in my purse but whenever I use them I’m reminded of why I have never and will never spend actual money on this product. I feel like this is an issue with a lot of sunscreen products and I’m not going to lie... I have tried many, many worse products in comparison to this. But for the price and for the quality I have learned to expect from Drunk Elephant products... this is absolutely subpar and one of their worst products.

My review is all my own and is my honest opinion. I loved this jar and the weight of it and how the moisturizer is packed in. It doesn’t look like there is much product in there but it really seems like there is now that I’ve been digging in. I didn’t realize how much product was actually in there and I’m very pleased now! The look of the jar is very sleek and innovative.  This moisturizer was a gel like consistency which I adore. It’s super light and perfect for summer and it makes your skin feel silky and soft. It perfectly primes it for the next step in your routine. It’s nice because it just seeps into your skin so it doesn’t feel heavy or sticky. It also has a wonderful scent that last quite sometime. I’ve been using it in the Morning and Evening for a few weeks now.  It is a bit pricey and I would prefer to spend less. I really like it and I will most likely buy it again once it runs out because I love how it feels makes my skin feel and how quick it absorbs.

I am 37 and I definitely have had a slowdown in my skin’s turnover. Currently I’m unable to use RetinA so I need both physical and chemical exfoliation 2x/week. I have always used Exfolikate, but I was excited to try this product. I followed instructions and left it on for 3 minutes. The texture is great! Doesn’t feel harsh or scratchy on the skin. It also did not irritate some if the areas that I had some redness already. The smell is pleasant and unobtrusive. During use, I felt a tingle, nothing uncomfortable.  Afterward, my skin definitely looked polished and the pores looked slightly more refined. My nose blackheads did not look any different. I have not used it multiple times yet, but I would not call this a substitute for regular facials/microderm.  Since I applied moisturizer and primer and makeup afterward, the true test was going to be if I had flaky, patchy or ashy skin after applying my makeup— and this passed. There was a small dry patch between my eyes on my forehead, but that may have been due to my own lack of gently scrubbing that area. So yes, I was satisfied with this product. However, there is one issue: I felt the amount received for the price is not good. I would NOT pay $125 for 1.7 oz of this product when I have paid $85 for 2 oz of Exfolikate, which has given me very good results as well. Having said that, I did NOT break out the next few days— which has happened to me with Exfolikate on occasion. I do believe that this is protective of the skin barrier as advertised. While the price is a major deterrent for me and enough to take one star off, in truth this is a good, but not mind-blowing, product with a high performing list of ingredients. I would recommend it if you have skin that doesn’t like harsher scrubs, still need the physical/chemical exfoliation and of course, money is no object.","Good product, non-irritating, but high price tag",lightMedium,brown,combination,black,P459299,Mini GOOPGLOW Microderm Instant Glow Exfoliator,goop,42.0,1988

It’s true but it’s more like what the skin feels like after applying a serum or moisturizer. It’s tacky but I won’t say it’s oily. If you expect it to disappear to nothingness when dried (like water), this is not for you. smell: it’s not pleasant but neither is it unpleasant. the smell reminds of burned rubber but it is not strong. there is maybe a hint of citrus but if you like your product to smell like perfume this is not for you.Redness: I did not see any redness but again,  I am taking repercussions by applying a layer of light moisturizer first, and I can tell you it still stinged and the sting, though mild, lasted for a while after application. If your skin is sensitive or are unsure how your skin will react to it, you might consider doing the same (it’s still going to work, just less unpleasantly).Overall this product serves its purpose.

This one is different I can tell the formulation was stronger upon application. Because this is the first time I felt vitamin C tingle. I’ve been using it every day for the last five days and I can tell that one of my dark spots is light lighting up. I’m a runner and I try to prevent sun damage on my face. It’s something even if you use the best sunscreen and wear a hat if you spend a lot of time outside sun damage is going to happen no matter what. I’ve even tried laser facials which were very expensive and they didn’t make  a difference. I will continue using this even if it only lightens it up a little bit it’s still doing much better than the lasers ever did. The funny part is the Very Cherry serum  didn’t help at all but this one is definitely much better than that one. I was gifted this item but don’t let that influence you at all I honestly came into this thinking this serum wouldn’t work. I paid a lot for Cherry line (the serum and eye cream) and wasn’t impressed so I didn’t have high expectations for this one. I am so happy that I was wrong.

Overall I’m quite impressed with this serum, it works at benefiting your skin in so many different ways. Initially while applying the serum, I was a bit taken away by the burning sensation that it’s ingredients caused, but within half an hour or so the burning went away. This serum helps fight against acne, aging, pores, and so much more! Like the Drunk Elephant Whipped Cream, this serum is good for all skin types, whether you have oily skin, combination, normal or excessive dryness. Furthermore I can appreciate the inclusion of salicylic acid, an ingredient I’m very familiar with, helping not only fight, but prevent problematic acne. Likewise, I think it is very important to say that if you’re expecting to maximize your results, you truly need to pair the moisturizer with this serum or at least something similar, because I wouldn’t see these products being successful without eachother. Finally, like the cream I would appreciate a little scent of some sort, I noticed that raspberry extract was apart of the ingredients to help rehydrate and smooth skin, perhaps a concentrate can be used for a subtle scent of raspberry! Having said that, there is a bit of oiliness in the serum that goes away once your skin absorbs the ingredients, though I wouldn’t post that as problematic since it is a nighttime serum.

I have combination oily skin but I also struggle with ezxcema so I can get dry as well. It’s a struggle bus let me tell you! Like anything else there are pros and cons. Pros: simple ingredient list, vegan (so pretty natural based ingredients), barely any fragrance, does feel pretty clean after emulsifying and then washing face Cons: pricey (I don’t mind spending the money on good products for my face and I love how this brand does use nice ingredients and is recycle friendly but that dollar amount) even though there aren’t any harsh chemicals or soaps to dry out your face. My face felt tight and dry after drying but still felt dirty in the t zone. For that reason alone is why I won’t be repurchasing. Doesn’t last as some other face washes I’ve used in the past from other brands. Maybe that’s because of the feeling of not being able to get my t zone to feel clean and refreshed idk.

Also, look how cute the packaging is, pretty pink and adorable wooden cap. #freeproduct #trywithtopbox",No Title,light,brown,oily,brown,P472451,Vinosource-Hydra Moisturizing Mask,Caudalie,42.0,887

I used it for about 1 week and a half. During this time of use I had perioral dermatitis on my chin area. So I was concerned if using this product was going to irritate me or not. I gave it a go and glad that I did. I saw that while using it that it helped calm the redness on my chin and helped those dry spots I get there as well. The redness was bad the first 2 days but within the 4th day I saw the redness going away. I noticed that it was helping the rest of my skins texture I was having a hard time dealing with too. I have some fine line concerns and saw improvement in those areas. My skin felt really nice and hydrated after each use. I am new to this whole skin care game and learning about my skin. I have oily t zone and the rest of my face is dry for reference. ( The perioral dermatitis only shows up for me in fall or winter seasons for reference as well. )  So trying this out I liked it alot and will continue to keep this as a skin care must.,First timer using Tatcha,lightMedium,hazel,dry,brown,P474377,Indigo Overnight Repair Serum in Cream Treatment,Tatcha,92.0,1105

The vitamin c I was using prior didn’t contain any l-ascorbic acid, which is not a good thing if you actually want the vitamin c to absorb into your cells, and since this one contains the recommended 15%, I decided to take a chance. And oh, was it worth it. I assumed this would be one of those things that helped over time, but wouldn’t do much instantly. So when I saw myself in a mirror a few hours later and my skin was glowing and my dark undereye circles were noticeably lighter, I was shocked. The container is opaque, which is great because vitamin C is very unstable and I appreciate that it protects the product from light. I loved mixing it myself since it means this will stay potent longer. Some people say it’s hard to pour, but I didn’t think so. Before pouring in the serum, tap the powder container on a hard surface a few times to unstick it from the bottom of the container. This is what I did, and I didn’t have any powder stuck at the bottom after I poured in the serum and shook it for a minute. This product doesn’t have any added scent, so I can understand how someone might be really sensitive to smells and not like that. However, the fact that it is unscented is great for your skin, and its natural scent doesn’t smell bad to me: I might compare the smell to something like baby powder or baking soda. It’s not overpowering in my opinion. The worst part is that it’s a little sticky, but for me, personally, that’s not a problem. I don’t wear makeup most days, so I’m willing to deal with a little bit of a sticky product when it’s this good.

The mask is pulling the oil out. when the clay mask dries out, its very comfortable no tightness or itchy.I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family.#freeproduct #trywithtopbox",No Title,lightMedium,brown,combination,brown,P468658,Volcanic AHA Pore Clearing Clay Mask,innisfree,16.0,516

I feel that the Inkey list is far superior in performance and stronger than the ToL one, I even feel it working throughout the day. I even received compliments on my skin after a few weeks of using it (even when wearing masks). Since I used this during Covid times, I rarely wore makeup and I felt this retinol product was an important part of my routine to look acceptable makeup-free. This may have softened and smoothed lines around my eyes. I also like the fact that a little dab of this stuff goes a long way (even spreadable down to my neck). Finally, the price is super awesome and affordable! For these reasons, I gave this product 5 stars.However, I do think that this retinol is a bit strong for people beginning with using retinol in their face routine. I can see this irritating skin new to retinol users, so I am happy to have used ToL as an introduction to retinol and then take it up notch with Inkey list. I don’t think I would have given this product 5 stars if I were new to retinol. The texture of this product is nice with a touch (I mean a super-light touch) of grittiness (that easily melts and gets into a smooth consistency after a few seconds in contact with my body heat). I am somewhat sensitive tactile-wise, so I do notice little things like this. In no way I’m saying that this product exfoliates; I still do use exfoliants in my routine. It also has a hint of sugar cane-like smell. It also looks like a bit of condensed milk.

Cons: - Stayed “wet“ for a while (like my hair would get stuck to my face if the wind blew). - Even though it seemed hydrating my dry skin seemed to be getting drier (this is common with zinc sunscreens).

She recommended me this make up remover and I am super happy with it. Everything that she told me about it is true. It removes all your make up even the masacra. Is a gentle wax paste that it will melt while you massage it in your face with your hands to remove your make up. Is super soft and it has a very gentle aroma. I feel like at the spa when I am applying it! HahahAfter I clean it with water And once I dry my face with a clean towel my skin looks clean, smooth and fresh. So this product worked for me. I just have to be carefully when I apply it on me eyes to remove my mascara, so it doesn’t get inside my eyes. But this can happen with any other make uo remover.

I’ve always taken excellent care of my skin, including regular facials & peels, and I use great products. I’ve always “invested” in my skin.For reasons not worth getting into, I stopped getting monthly peels, and after about 6 months my skin had broken out HORRIFICALLY on the cheeks and chin. Nothing was helping. I saw my dermatologist, who put me on a short course of antibiotics along with cleansing using Neutragena’s Acne wash. This got the blemishes under control but I still had lots of texture and clogging that just wouldn’t let up. Squeezing these clogs would create a huge inflamed bump, so I did my best to leave them alone. Not easy, it looked awful and they wouldn’t go away.During the VIB sale, I decided to pick up this peel and I’m sooooo glad I did! I’ve been using this for about a month now, and almost all my bumps and clogs are gone. I honestly can’t believe it! The directions say to leave on no more than 10 minutes, and the peel should be used no more than twice a week. I have very tough skin from years of strong peels, and I know what I can handle. This is my current regime: I’ve been doing my entire face once a week for 10 minutes, and my lower face (cheeks and chin only) every other night for 10-13 minutes and WOW. Note:This is pretty drying, but it’s done the job. Just be sure to load up on your serums and moisturizer before bed. I recommend The Ordinary’s Buffet, and Niacinamide + Zinc, which are both part of my daily routine. Lastly, to moisturize I use either Elemis, DHC, or Charlotte Tillbury since all three are extra moisturizing for my particular skin.I also see my scars and hyperpigmentation starting to fade.At this price point, you can’t go wrong. I hope everyone else has the same results as I have.

Let me tell you, I have several different brands from, glam glow to Kate Somerville as well as exfoliating pads and they’re all nice but this one is my favorite. The biggest reason is the ease of use, I simply wet my hands and put some on my hand and rub it together and it turns into a creamy foam that gently exfoliates your face. It’s not harsh but it is extremely effective because after I use it my skin is baby bottom soft. This one just gives me the best results and I enjoy the process of using it. I use it in rotation with other products so the small size last me a very long time. However I find myself reaching for this one more often so I am going to upgrade to the large bottle.

Earlier in my skincare journey I did but felt like none were significantly better than any other popular one regardless of price point or texture.Later, effective concentrations both B3 & every version of HA became ubiquitous “bonus” ingredients in all kinds of cosmeceuticals (Ex: Barrier recovery products, Sensitive skin products, Acne products, Anti-Aging products, Toners, etc) & unsurprisingly these other products gave me all the same benefits of the B3/HA serums & more. The serums became useless since using them alongside the other products did not intensify skin benefits.Got the 8mL sample size of this for free w/ a previous order. Perfectly lightweight, deeply hydrates every perceivable skin layer, massages in so smoothly, not tacky after application but doesn’t quickly evaporate off either, soothing if my skin is irritated & seems to negate dehydration from of tretinoin gel.Not sure that this truly brightens skin overtime any better than most B3 products, but the serum is unique for me in that it grants me an appreciable makeup-like “instant gratification effect.” While the serum is applied it makes my complexion appear notably more dewy, glowy, supple & “healthy”. It does give the advertised dewy & glowy look NOT an oily/greasy look. Makes my face+neck skin look amazing under a lightweight moisturizer & tinted hybrid sunscreen. If you use mattifying or pore primer only use it on your problem areas instead of all over your face so you don’t lose these beautiful effects.I love it but resent wanting the full size serum cuz $40 is A LOT to spend on a product-type that you entirely cut out of your routine years ago because it was unnecessary for getting/maintaining great skin.

This product is by no means clinical, which is really what I need for my melasma and hyperpigmentation from the sun and acne, so it hasn’t put a dent in my the areas of my face that are most in need of lightening and brightening. However, for someone with mildly uneven skintone or average skin, this product could easily make holy grail status. The consistency of the serum itself is lovely. It’s not watery, oily, sticky, heavy, patchy, or tinted. I feel like my skin absorbs it well. It wears really nicely under other skincare products and/or makeup. While the Vitamin C provides the greatest benefit in the daytime, there’s no reason the product can’t be used twice a day. I didn’t notice any fragrance. I have combination, cystic acne prone skin and had no issues with breakouts, clogged pores, burning, itching, or skin sensitivity. Basically, you can’t overdo it with this product and you don’t have to fear a skin purging period. At $62/oz. its price is more than fair for the quality and potency of the ingredients used and for the length of time one bottle will last you. You’ll find the same ingredients in La Prairie Serums and Lotions, which cost $250-650+. Summer Friday’s CC Me Serum is $64/oz and probably one of the most comparable “new” serums on the market in terms of claims, ingredients, availability, usage and price point. If you didn’t like the tackiness of the CC Me Serum or the fact that you probably blew through it in a month, I would give this one a try. Products like CC Me are great if you’re barefaced, not applying other products, and are looking for an instant gratification, dewy glow. The Biossance Serum will take time to see results, but it plays well with other skincare and makeup products and is more likely to have a lasting impact on the look and feel of your skin.","Gentle, No Breakouts, Progressive Improvement!",light,blue,combination,brown,P467110,Squalane + 10% Vitamin C Dark Spot Serum,Biossance,65.0,1913

The cream feels okay on the face, but isn’t super hydrating like my go-to moisturizer— and my skin honestly didn’t feel or look amazing after using it.

I don’t think it works miracles, but I know my skin is smoother and softer whenever I use it. The real reason I keep it around is that it helps other skincare products absorb better. My skin just drinks up my toner and moisturizer after I apply this serum. I also enjoy the herbal scent and the heavy glass bottle -- it just makes the whole product experience more pleasant. One star off because it’s not a miracle-worker like Dr Dennis Gross Retinol and Ferulic overnight treatment. It’s just - consistently good at making my skin look better.I wouldn’t recommend this product for anyone with dry skin because of the alcohol in it. Alcohol isn’t the kiss of death with skincare products -- the reason so many companies put it in their products is that it makes the active ingredients absorb better into your skin! However, it does that by weakening your moisture barrier so that ingredients can penetrate better. For that reason, you shouldn’t use more than one product with alcohol in it -- the effect of multiple applications of alcohol to the skin is much worse than a single application per day. People with dry skin should avoid products containing alcohol, as they can exacerbate dryness. Those of us with normal or oily/combination skin are probably safe to use one (1) alcohol-based active skincare product per day. For me, the benefits of the First Care Activating Serum outweigh the potential negatives. I’ve repurchased like 5x and will continue to do so.","Repurchased multiple times, improves skin texture",fair,blue,combination,red,P476729,Mini First Care Activating Serum,Sulwhasoo,25.0,1606

Just use a tiny amount for your entire face and once you get the hang of how little you need you will see that it isnt greasy. My skin is ultra sensitive to several products, mostly scented ones, they immediately break me out, but no issues with this one since theres no fragrance whatsoever.

You know those people who take every night to do a ritual of double cleansing, acids, potentially retinol, creams, etc. and then another separate morning routine--that’s me! I know that retinoids, AHAs, Hyluronic acid, and everything else is a waste of money and time if I don’t protect my skin from UV rays. So when I heard Shisheido had a new sunscreen that was SPF 50+, I was beyond excited to try it. I took a few weeks of using the sunscreen every day to see how it would affect my skin and here are my thoughts and review:PROS:-no white cast--it does blend beautifully into skin tones and is cosmetically elegant-broad spectrum means it protects against UBV (cause DNA damage--bruns, skin cancers, etc) and UVA rays (travel deeper and cause damage in collagen and structure of skins--aging!) (yay!)-it comes with a lot of product for the cost (I apply it on my face, ears, and neck!)-it is ocean friendly which I love personally-spf 30 is the minimum recommendation but an SPF 50 makes it easier in case I don’t wear enough product some days-I teach hot yoga and work out in a heated room every day and this has staying power through 90 minute classes!CONS:-it does feel like a heavier sunscreen that has a bit of a dewier/oilier finish (I don’t personally mind as I put it on under my makeup and it gives it a nice dewy finish).-it has a light fragrance to it (if you’re sensitive or avoiding fragrance--something to note, but it smells nice!)This is worth it’s value 100%.

The reason that I spring for this is that it gives me a ruddiness that makes me look robust and not just tanned. The caveat is to make sure you use a tiny amount in a viscous enough serum or moisturizer to spread evenly and thinly enough so you don’t look like you have spent too much time under a sunlamp. I find that it often looks more natural the next day after I have washed my  face with my Clairisonic gentle cleansing brush.

It’s actually more like a cream and a gel had a baby and it’s beautiful. YES it is expensive. Very expensive for a tiny amount. That is the only reason I took away one star. BUT I have been using this for over two years now and I can truly attest to the fact that a LITTLE TEENY BIT goes a long long way. You need so little that it honestly took me almost a year to really get used to taking out the right amount on my ring finger to use for each eye. It is basically a dab light of the finger on the top of the cream and that’s all you need. It’s kind of insane how hydrating and moisture packed it is. So that is why I’d say it’s worth it to pay full price. I used the little sample sizes that the beauty bazaar had a while back but once I ran out of those I knew I couldn’t like without it so I pulled the trigger and bought the full size.

I was definitely getting crows feet before I started using this. Now they are basically non-existent. Also my eyes are SUPER sensitive and this stuff does not irritate my eyes or eye skin at all.

Regardless, though, I am interested in this brand in general, and it’s not like I had to spend any extra money to get to try out this sample product, so why not, right?While I appreciate the quite luxurious appearance and packaging of this product (of both the actual full size AND the little sample I received for free), I can’t really think of any reason I, or anyone, should ever pay $125 for one single fluid ounce of this stuff. It’s honestly really rather comparable to my other cbd and hemp seed facial oils in my collection, ones that have a muuuuch lower and, in my opinion, more reasonable price tag. Nothing about this ’serum’ or oil, whatever you wanna call it, stood out to me as being particularly special or more luxurious than similar, cheaper products from other brands. I’m definitely glad I was able to try the sample of this, though, because I likely would have been super disappointed if I had ever convinced myself to purchase the full size product, or even the 0.3 fl oz version for $38 USD. I’d much rather spend that $ on other, more unique products...",Just Okay tbh...

The packaging is simple and easy. There’s no lid or cap on the product; you simply turn the pump and it locks. The product itself is a lightweight purple liquid that you rub in upward, circular motions onto your face and neck, avoiding the eyes. I use this product after I’ve cleansed my skin and before I apply moisturizer. Once it’s been rubbed into the skin, it leaves a gorgeous glow and makes me look instantly awake. It absorbs into the skin quickly which is also great. I have noticed a difference in how my skin looks and feels. My pores appear smaller and I have less discoloration. I can’t wait to see the improvement after several weeks. I’d highly recommend this product if you’re concerned with your pores, dark spots, or just need an instant glow.

This kit includes their cleansing foam, balancing water, first care activating serum, and concentrated ginseng eye cream. This is my first time trying Sulwhasoo so it was fitting to start with their trial sizes, and I’m really impressed.The cleansing foam is very lightweight and lathers up beautifully, leaving my skin feeling clean without being stripped or dry. The serum has a lightweight gel consistency that has a pleasant herbal smell, which I enjoy. It automatically hydrates, nourishes, and revitalizes my dry, dull skin -- it also enhances the absorption of all other products applied afterwards. The balancing water has a viscous gel consistency that sort of melts into the skin, transforming to a more watery substance. It feels very moisturizing and leaves my skin super soft after applying. As the last step, I apply the eye cream, which has a rich, velvety consistency that leaves my delicate eye area intensely moisturized and soothed. Since I’ve began using this routine, I have definitely seen an improvement in my overall skintone, texture, and hydration.

I used different treatments under this to help (seriously an organic nipple cream/salve used for breast feeding was the only thing that helped). So eyes are good, started using this alone again on bare skin a few days ago and later that same day intense itching and redness on both eyes (under eye and eye lids).

The US is notoriously behind when it comes to sun protection — the FDA hasn’t approved new filters in decades, an issue that doesn’t appear even close to changing anytime soon. With all these limitations, Supergoop still managed to create a very elegant product with no white cast and with a texture that most people will find enjoyable to work with. Better yet, this doubles as the perfect blurring primer for people who wear makeup. Even if you don’t wear makeup, you’ll probably appreciate the diminished appearance of your pores. The finish of the Unseen Sunscreen isn’t dewy nor mattifying. Instead, it’s got a natural finish and a velvety feel. I’m not giving it five stars because, while this has pretty high protection against UVB rays (the ones that cause burning and cancer), it doesn’t offer much against UVA rays (the ones that cause wrinkles and other signs of aging).

I have very sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts and dryness and I have struggled to find a thick, hydrating night moisturizer that does not cause issues for me. I started out with the mini size, loved it... purchased a full size and have been using it for about 1-2 months and was SURE to purchase a backup during the sale. This product will last a while but I did not want to run the risk of running out. Now, for claims. Hydration. YES. I use a thin layer of this overnight as a night moisturizer and wake up to hydrated but not greasy skin. I think some folks may be running into issues applying this like a MASK (big thick layer). You truly only need  a thin layer to get beautiful hydration. Plump. I never really know what this is supposed to mean and I feel it goes hand in hand with hydration. Brightening. This is always hard to evaluate however I do struggle with hyperpigmentation caused by hormonal breakouts and I find that that hyperpigmentation has been fading on a quicker timeline since I have begun using this so I will say that even though I think it is very hard to evaluate a claim like “brightens“ I do feel like those dark spots are responding well to the vitamin C in this product. Clean. Everyone’s skin is different and sensitive skin is a fickle beast. This has NOT caused issues for me with sensitivity, breakouts, allergic reactions.

My lips chap easily and it’s really bad this winter, so I had been applying Vaseline on my every night in preparation for wearing creamy lipstick the following morning. That was definitely not enough to make my lips smooth. I got a deluxe sample of Laneige’s lip mask and found it to be fantastic, so I got the full size and use it every night. I marked this as four stars instead of five because when I wipe it off in the morning, I have to be very precise in order to not get it on the skin around my lips. It leaves a sort of sticky residue that dries the skin and makes it more difficult to evenly apply foundation after that. Instead of using a towel to take it off, I moisten a folded paper towel and smooth it over my lips so that I can make sure it doesn’t smear off on my skin. It’s easy to adjust, but it can be frustrating when I’m putting my makeup on at 5am and am barely awake and screw it up from not paying attention! That being said, I would definitely recommend this as a way better alternative to simple lip balm or lip masks/rubs with rough particles to smooth the lips. This mask is really creamy and feels like lip gloss. It also smells of cotton candy too! :)Overall, I’m really glad I took the plunge and bought this!",Perfect for Preparing to Apply Matte Lipstick,fair,blue,combination,brown,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,1388

Being a healthcare professional, I know for a fact that oral vitamins/supplements (or anything taken orally, actually!) will take a while to absorb into the body, and will not be 100% absorbed due to the various “places it goes through.“ That being said, this product may take a while to see its effects on the skin, plus that it was specified to expect results in 8-12 weeks. With only 5 packets to try, I’m not really sure if I would be able to notice any results at this time. And while our oral intake greatly affects the appearance of our skin, I also believe that topical products work better when addressing skin problems. Overall, I quite enjoyed drinking this supplement in the morning. I got some energy boost, thanks to the CoQ10, but felt like I was taking usual vitamins that my patients do. I would recommend it as a supplement to your usual skin care routine, but I would rather use my serums and other topical treatments that allow you to see results in a few days of use.",typical daily vitamins,light,brown,dry,brown,P456211,GOOPGLOW Morning Skin Superpowder,goop,60.0,1106

Because of this rough start, I just continued to use my favourite lip balms and used this occasionally to see if I would grow to like it. Now! The weather is much less dry than it was in the winter when I got this (and in turn my lips aren’t flakey anymore) and I wear this as a lip balm day and night. It has a really nice feel on the lips and smells divine- a kind of vanilla berry perfume. It has a glossy look but feels like a very creamy balm (not sticky like a gloss and not oily like a chapstick) and a pale pink tint which as a pale person suits me nicely for the day. Is this product revolutionary/worth the hype? No. Aside from its creamy texture and sweet scent which add to the experience of wearing this lip mask it doesn’t give results any better than your regular lip balm. If you are looking for a lip product that feels creamy and has a glowy finish with a nice smell the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask could be for you. If, however, you are looking for an intensive overnight mask for chapped lips, this product won’t do it for you.",Not for chapped/flakey lips,fairLight,blue,combination,brown,P420652,Lip Sleeping Mask Intense Hydration with Vitamin C,LANEIGE,24.0,1202

I was super excited for the opportunity to try the Wild Huckleberry 8-Acid Polishing Peel because I’m always on the hunt for the peel that’s going to give me baby smooth skin. This peel may not have delivered, but it was perfectly satisfactory. The peel went on pretty smoothly considering the texture of the cream. I felt a slight tingling sensation as the product sat on my skin, but nothing intense. After the suggested time of 5 minutes was up, I wet my hands and gently rubbed the cream into my skin and allowed the granules to scrub. After rinsing, my skin felt slightly smoother, but there wasn’t a dramatic difference. I didn’t experience any skin sensitivity either. I would recommend using this peel maybe once or twice a month because of the coarse exfoliating particles in the cream, which I would be reluctant to use on my face.

They are not completely gone  but there is improvement and I can finally see the light at the end of this annoying acne tunnel. I have very sensitive skin so this does not irritate or burn my skin ( I have oily skin). I understand the smell can be intense but nothing I personally can’t handle. It smells like “nair“.

I use it to dermaplane because I have acne scars that I’m trying to level out and the fact that it also removes the hair is a plus for me, but I didn’t purchase it simply to remove hair. Wash and prep your face, pull all your hair back from your face and go slow. I typically have a damp paper towel beside me to wipe off dead skin and hairs as I go. I use a well lit magnification mirror to make sure I can see if I missed anything as you can see some hairs better when light hits them at certain angles. Once I’m done, I use a new damp paper towel or a cool damp rag to wipe my face and catch any remaining skin/hairs.

It was so awful! I immediately washed my face with a gentle cleanser and used this repair cream that I luckily had a sample of because it was the only moisturizer I had that didn’t have anything irritating or active in it and within minutes the redness and uncomfortableness had subsided and within 2 days my face was almost back to normal and feels sooo much better I immediately ordered the full size and the fruit-tox to fulfill my need for a deeper clean/exfoliation without annihilating my moisture barrier again like the foaming face wash did. So thankful for this stuff! I reasearched the company after it miraculously healed my face and turns out the founder of this brands mother owns a cosmetics lab and is cofounder or Peter Thomas Roth so its easy to see the quality is top notch and im sure she saved the best formulas for her daughters company and PTR.

I tend to have dry skin so I was afraid that the alcohol which back in the day is what toners were notorious for kept me from using them. No stripping and drying out the skin for this girl. That being said toners are formulated now with more skin-friendly ingredients and offer many amazing benefits that do not dry the skin out. Instead they restore skin’s pH, minimize pores and hydrate or exfoliate, creating a complexion that’s more radiant and improving your skin’s overall texture. REN Clean Skincare Ready Steady Glow Daily AHA Tonic delivers brighter skin with a gentle toner that won’t irritate even sensitive skin with daily use. I was super excited when I heard that this toner didn’t have alcohol in it. REN is formulated with lactic acid and salicin from willow bark extract, which are gentle but still powerful with their exfoliating agents that brighten tired skin, break down buildup and minimize the appearance of pores. My overall thoughts: I loved the light citrus scent. It is not overpowering and dissipates quickly. After a couple weeks of using this product I have noticed my complexion looks clearer and brighter overall. I also have been using this on my daughters back and have noticed improvement in her to acne scars. I also believe my hyperpigmentation is a little lighter and overall my skin seemed to look plumper and more hydrated.

No self tanner makes streaks. The user makes streaks. What is a streak? It is a mark of tan beside non tan. I saturate myself like I just came out of a lagoon and barely super lightly swipe a mitt over the wetness. I do NOT rub and blend. That’s taking most of the tan off. Apply (any) tanner VERY generously, guide color or not (especially not, and with guide it will wash off in am shower. Voila. No streaks cuz all of your skin is covered). Back is easy with spritz: I stick out my butt, spray over my shoulders so heavy til it drips, and quickly, before it drips too far, spread it all around lower mid & upper back in that order with gloved hands (I can reach every inch of my back fortunately). Another amazing use is on a hot day. Keep in fridge, and spritz one big spray square onto the middle of your face (makeup, no makeup, no matter). Do not touch it (no blending or anything - use like any face mist). Refreshing as heck and you’re tan later! Just don’t wash your face for hours. Purple SPRAY (not drops) is star of IOP lineup. It not only has DHA but erythrulose, another strong tan agent which takes longer to develop and creates a darker tan with more longevity (I’m surprised IOP doesn’t advertise this). So leave on for an eternity if possible like 24 hours seriously. I’m naturally nw20-30 and I never mess with anything but the darkest tan. I’m now nc43. One con: the spritz goes haywire occasionally. I don’t care. Will repurchase forever. So in love with their message of inclusivity. How rare. Unlike other brands who showcase exotic and born tan Far East long lithe supermodels prancing in subtropical sands in string bikinis. Sure they may have similar products.

I try to stop it by relaxing the muscles, but they keep returning to their tensed state. Enter the The Ordinary’s Argireline Solution 10%.The Argreline Solution has a short ingredient, it’s water based and free of oil, silicone, alcohol, and fragrance. The star ingredient is, obviously, Argireline or Acetyl Hexapeptide-8. This is a peptide that increases level of moisture on skin, reduces wrinkle depth, and most importantly, prevents contraction of small facial muscles that cause wrinkles (forehead lines, number 11’s, and crow’s feet).  The solution looks like a watery gel. It turns quickly into water on contact with skin. It’s immediately cooling, refreshing, and soothing. It’s not heavy, sticky, nor greasy. It disappears on skin, like I’ve applied nothing. I use this on my forehead — three drops, massage it in, making sure to concentrate between my brows, then I add another three drops. The key is to apply more than what you think is enough. This gives me relief from headaches and migraines. It’s temporary but it’s much needed. The best result was noticed after about three months of use and that is the reduction of tension between my eyebrows. Before, I was constantly forcing my brows to relax. Now, there’s no need because my brows aren’t unintentionally furrowed anymore. Yay!Cons:Took three months to actually see noticeable results.I’m on my second bottle and this has a different texture than the first. It’s very watery and not gel-like anymore.

It’s a beautiful bottle, which you shake to blend and bubble, before pressing to your face and neck with a cotton round. The bottle doesn’t pour, but rather, releases a meager allotment into the top of the bottle. By my estimate, the solution will last approximately forever if you allow the bottle to dictate your usage. Personally, I add another couple of pours to account for the cotton round absorbency. The magical elixir...ahem...essence, contains glycolic acid (exfoliation), grapeseed oil (antioxidant),  and beech bud extract (exfoliation and hydration). I appreciate that it doesn’t have parabens, mineral oil, sulfates, silicone, fragrance, phenoxyethanol, or colorant. This essence isn’t scented, and has the consistency of water. It does not feel oily or abrasive. It does have a subtle cooling sensation as the moisture evaporates from your skin. It did not irritate my sensitive skin. The essence is intended to exfoliate, nourish, minimize the appearance of pores, and make skin look smooth and radiant. Therefore, I prepare my skin with this product before applying make-up and sunscreen to shrink pores, and create a smooth and hydrated underlying surface. I also use it at night after cleansing.

It is very very dewy. However, it’d be a beautiful winter sunscreen for drier skin. It is a finely mixed formula that leaves a minimal white cast.

I do not think that this would work for anyone who has a medium to deep skintone. But to their credit, I will say the cast is very minimal.

It definitely comes out as a fluffy mousse, and once you start applying you have to work fast. That being said, it doesn’t take long (even for a novice like me) to master the application process, especially if you use a mitt. Some recommendations would be:1. Exfoliate right before and probably for a couple days before if possible;2. Don’t shave your legs right before tanning;3. Put moisturizer on knees, ankles, elbows, tops of feet and back of hands to minimize these areas getting too much product on them; 4. It dries fast, but the marker color will transfer so don’t put anything precious on until after you’ve showered that off.This stuff is now part of my weekly schedule; every Sunday I shower and exfoliate and then apply this stuff all over doing one leg, one arm, front torso and back torso at a time.

Though I really liked the formulation of their Mattescreen SPF, the tint was a little too dark for my liking (for reference, one of my closest shade matches is Fenty 120).I’ve been wearing this daily since I purchased it, and so far, I’m really enjoying it! The texture is thinner and more lightweight than other comparable sunscreens (like Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer), so it spreads nicely and blends in quickly on my fair skin tone. I could see someone with a deeper skin tone having trouble with the slight white cast though, so please be aware before purchasing. For me, the white cast does disappear after about 5 minutes, but I’m not sure if that’s simply due to the fact that I have fair skin.The finish is definitely more on the glowy side, which could be a positive or a negative depending on what you’re looking for. I would probably prefer if it were a *touch* more matte, but so far I haven’t experienced any breakouts or reactions from this, so I’m content. I also LOVE that it is truly fragrance-free and 100% mineral, as I have combo, sensitive, acne-prone skin that flushes easily.Overall, if you’re looking for a hydrating, glowy, mineral sunscreen with good SPF protection and no fragrance, I would definitely recommend this product! However, if you don’t enjoy the dewy look, or if you have more of a medium-deep skin tone, I would suggest trying a sample first if you can. Maybe in the future, Supergoop will even come out with a few tinted shades of this formulation for inclusivity! Though their Mattescreen caters to medium-deep skin tones with its tint, not everyone is looking for a pure matte finish.","So far, so good!",fair,green,combination,blonde,P482321,Mini Mineral Sheerscreen Sunscreen SPF 30 PA+++,Supergoop!,22.0,1713

In the second photo, you can see the color and texture of the product - I’d say it does lean slightly more towards being a gel than a cream moisturizing product, but I’d honestly hesitate to call it either one because I feel like it’s actually more accurately described as a sort of cream-gel hybrid. It’s very lightweight, like a gel, but also very, very powerfully hydrating like a typical thicker cream moisturizer. I did genuinely enjoy trying out this belif aqua bomb deluxe sample and especially enjoyed the soft, velvet-y smoothness it gave my skin right after being applied, but I don’t know that I’d ever go out of my way to purchase a full-size version of this particular moisturizer.

A little goes a long way and I would say even though the size is small, it’s a long lasting product. The dropper is fine and is useful for knowing how much to put on your skin. The color is unique. There is a slight berry smell from it which I only guess is from the ingredient fruit extract. I should mention I have fair skin and I do suffer from mild hormonal acne (I mostly get closed comedones or 1-2 cysts). Upon putting on the product I get a tingle sensation (this is a chemical exfoliator so nothing to stress about) I leave on for ten minutes and when washing off make sure to remove all of it, you could get a chemical burn if not careful. It leaves my skin tight and I do believe that it helps with evening out complexion. At first when using this I would purge in small whiteheads but after a while as my skin adjusted I no longer purge. The reason for the 4 stars is because while I do believe this would help those with hyperpigmentation or acne I personally haven’t seen any amazing results. Maybe it is too soon to say (I’ve been using about 2 months now) but my skin still has some dark spots. When using this product make sure not to overdo it because that could damage your skin, once a week works well for me. Also make sure to use sunscreen afterwards as your skin is in a fragile state after using this. Overall I do think this product is good especially for the price, and is probably one of the best exfoliators on the market. AHA/BHA’s are very good for those suffering from closed comedones. I love the packaging and I like the brand as a whole. I would recommend but just make sure to do a patch test before and be aware that you could potentially purge after first few uses. Make sure to follow instructions and you should be fine. Not an amazing product for me yet, but I do reach for it and I do think it has helped with my closed comedones.

They don’t really do much for eye makeup removal and there is a lot of tugging at my eyes every night when I wear makeup. So I tried Take the Day Off for my eye makeup remover to start. I thought it was only for eyes and lips. So I did use it ONLY on my EYES first (at my bathroom sink). Well glad I only tested it on my eyes first because I had HUGE black racoon eyes, it removed so much makeup I didn’t even know I had on- even without putting water on them! I used a splash of water from the faucet to try and remove it a bit but a big black line streamed down my face. I didn’t want black mascara soaking into the rest of my face- so I used a moistened cotton round (pulling) to remove the mascara (still some racoon eyes), then a dry cotton round to wipe more leftover product and makeup (hence, more pulling). So much pulling I had to go searching for an eye cream, after one use! So I am not sure which is better the wipes or Take The Day off for people who wear quite a bit of mascara a few days a week.  As with every cleanser for eyes or face there will always be residue. My best advice is to wipe with a tiny bit of makeup remover on a cotton swab roll over it twice, dry it once over with the other side and leave it. Try not to ever touch your eyes!!!",Wipes V.

It feels and preforms just like Vaseline but Vaseline is way cheaper and doesn’t have the weird smell. It works like any other thick lip balm. I don’t get it.

This is highly effective, pleasant all around anti-aging eye cream that I will continue to purchase.

I was both intrigued and nervous when I saw there was a new sheet mask to its lineup - intrigued because it’s a 2-piece cream-infused mask; nervous because I wasn’t sure if this was a replacement for the sheet mask already in the collection or in addition to it. My curiosity got the better of me & I purchased one. This is my honest and authentic opinion, as a Sephora Beauty Insider Community Ambassador.tl;dr: This 2-piece Airy-texTM fabric sheet mask is infused on one side with a rich, but not overly thick or heavy cream, and wears comfortably,  hugging the contours of the face and providing instant moisture & nourishment. This is an absolute “must have“ in the winter months for all but the oiliest of skin types, and a dream mask all year-round for those with dry, very dry or damaged skin. WHAT I LIKE:* 2-piece mask - I love 2 piece masks as they are easier to apply, fit better, and make for a more comfortable masking session* Material is soft, thin * Wears comfortably - hugs the contour of my face & feels soothing on the skin* Cream infused mask - rich, but not overly thick or heavy* Intensely moisturizing & nourishing - my winter dry skin LOVES this maskAREA(S) FOR IMPROVEMENT:* It’s on the pricey side for a sheet mask, BUT to me, this is worth it. Especially for those dealing with dry or very dry skin or a damaged skin barrier. FYI:* Each piece is individually packaged and based on the packaging for each, the bottom half is applied first, then the top half. * I don’t pick up a scent from the mask* This has become a new favorite mask* Highly recommend for those with dry or very dry skin, or dealing with a damaged or compromised skin barrier.

I mistakenly curled up one of the corners and was not able to recover from there. I can tell the material is higher quality more flexible and thinner than other ones I have tried in the past. However the second I tried to put foundation on top it was very obvious I had a sticker on my face. Honestly I think they’re more invisible without anything on top of them . So kudos for creating a thinner acne sticker that is less detectable and more flexible on the skin. I would not recommend using it with make up on top unfortunately.

My skin feels soft, plump and dewy without looking & feeling like I used a serum. The water-light formula Fresh is using for this is great. It is not thick if you’re expecting that. It is light, refreshing and dissolves into your skin as water would but leaves it feeling hydrated. I’ve been using it am & pm and can feel and see the benefits of it. The rose smell is sweet although a little strong at first, if you’re not used to scents, but the scent fades quickly once on your face. Be sure to shake it well to thoroughly mix the water and oil then put small dabs into your hand before applying to clean skin.

It doesn’t feel like a moisturizer on and yet it does leave your skin feeling a bit more hydrated but not smothered. Basically, if you are one of those people who hates the feeling of moisturizer, I think you might like this product. However, the smell is certainly worth noting. If you are sensitive to fragrance, do know that it has an orange scent to it.As for the vitamin C, this is a very interesting form found in this product. It’s a newer derivative that apparently originated in Korea. From the manufacturer studies, it sounds like this could be a more potent alternative to vitamin C itself. But there’s always a pro/con in trying new ingredients, and that is: limited data. Limited data is not the same as “doesn’t work”, and it’s certainly possible that Dermalogica is several steps ahead of other brands! But again, unless you have a crystal ball (and a science degree?

After trying the dermatologist and not getting any results, her confidence dropping, I decided to scour the reviews and internet for something that would be strong enough to make a dent, but also easily accessible.

Now she doesn’t have full blown acne, but whiteheads and small bumps on one spot on her forehead.  We have continued to use this every other night to every 2 nights due to her age and not wanting her skin to build a tolerance to it.  With our continued use I have to say this has worked to dramatically reduce and eliminate her whiteheads and bumps.

I have been using it now for several weeks and I truly do think that I see less fine lines and more even skin tone now than I had before I began using this.

It has an interesting texture; it feels almost chalky as well as a bit oily, but then it absorbs immediately, leaving my skin very smooth and hydrated but not greasy. It has a very slight, pleasant fragrance. I usually apply about a pea-sized amount on each side of my face, which is more than sufficient. I love how this makes my skin feel and look!
